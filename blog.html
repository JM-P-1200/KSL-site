      <h2>Off-Grid Morning Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Waking up in the hills feels different. The silence is loud in its own way, like the whole place is waiting for you to start moving. My mornings start with boiling water over a small portable burner, checking the battery level on the solar controller, then opening the laptop and hoping the WiFi gods are in a good mood today.</p>
      <p>There’s something odd but grounding about coding while the sunrise hits the bamboo walls. Maybe it slows me down enough to actually think. Or maybe I'm just desperate for stability and this place gives me an excuse to pretend I have some.</p>

      <h2>Client Deadlines in the Rain</h2>
      <p>Rainstorms hit harder in Sitio Kawayanan. When the roof starts rattling, I know the WiFi is preparing to abandon me. Deadlines don't care about the weather though. So I sit there, typing at full speed, trying to push commits before the signal collapses.</p>
      <p>Still, there's charm in fighting through it. Every finished project feels like a small victory against nature's mood swings. And honestly? I think these messy setups make the stories better.</p>

    <h1>About Miguiel Encinares</h1>
    <p>Living off-grid in Purok 4, Sitio Kawayanan, Miguiel rebuilt his life around silence, sunlight, and lines of code that only sometimes behave. Born Dec 8, 1998, he grew up bouncing between tech tinkering and escaping the world long enough to breathe. Now he builds tools, templates, and small systems for people who want the web to feel simple again.</p>
    <p>Most days he's either debugging under a bamboo roof, arguing with a dying WiFi signal, or working with clients from the US, UK, and Riyadh. He believes simplicity wins. And working quietly makes better work.</p>
